After the trial staff determines the drugs available at the hospital, the WHO website randomizes the hospitalized subject to one of the trial drugs or to the hospital standard of care for treating COVID-19.
As pointed out in the recent ECDC rapid risk assessment, a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-COV-2, with a shift from a containment to a mitigation approach, as the anticipated rapid increase in the number of cases may not provide decision makers and hospitals enough time to comprehend, accept and adapt their response accordingly if not implemented ahead of time.
In this regard, molecular determinants in this important area of virus-host interaction remain to be identified and characterized.

Though the virus is not generally airborne, the National Academy of Science has suggested that bioaerosol transmission may be possible and air collectors positioned in the hallway outside of people's rooms yielded samples positive for viral RNA.
Thus, it is more critical and practical to isolate B cells from recovered patients and identify the genetic codes encoding effective antibodies or screen for effective antibodies against essential proteins of the virus.
This means minimising contact with others by keeping a distance of six feet or two meters from them and avoiding gathering together in groups.
Reports from February (when the majority of the cases had still been confined to China) have documented racist sentiments expressed in various groups worldwide of Chinese people deserving the virus or receiving what has been claimed as justified retribution.

If it adapts well, its transmission in humans would be difficult to stop by quarantine or other infection control measures.
Finally, for some underlying health conditions and risk factors, including neurologic disorders, chronic liver disease, being a current smoker, and pregnancy, few severe outcomes were reported; therefore, conclusions cannot be drawn about the risk for severe COVID-19 among persons in these groups.
